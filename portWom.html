  <h2 Id="w" style="margin-top: 50px;">Overview</h2>
  <p style="font-family:Courier; font-size: 20px; color: grey; margin-left: 4%">
    In all mediums (TV, film, literature, news, etc.), women are often limited in their portrayal. Often being thin, very attractive, and somewhat useless, women in media are most often seen in a position subservient or dependent on men, imitating reality.
  <h2 Id="w">The Bechdel Test</h2>
  <p style="font-family:Courier; font-size: 20px; color: grey; margin-left: 4%">
    The Bechdel Test is a litmus test for female presence in fictional media. The test is named for Alison Bechdel, creator of the comic strip "Dykes to Watch Out For", who made it known to the world with this strip.
  In order to pass, the film or show must meet the following criteria:
  1. It includes at least two women
  2. Who have at least one conversation
  3. About something other than a man or men

  <h2 Id="w">Sexualization and Objectification</h2>
  <img style="margin-left: 250px; height: 30%; width: 30%; " src="https://blogs.bgsu.edu/ws2000su15/files/2015/07/1426618354_dolce-gabbana-ad-zoom.jpg">
  <img style="margin-left: 30px; height: 30%; width: 30%; " src="http://sexuallyobjectifiedwomen.weebly.com/uploads/9/5/1/3/9513520/8193464.jpg?338">
  <p style="font-family:Courier; font-size: 20px; color: grey; margin-left: 4%">
    Women are often used for fanservice, or to please the viewer, in media. This can be seen through the objectification of women's bodies in film as well as literature or pictures. For example, a woman in a novel may be portrayed solely as a love interest or object of desire. This is common in many action films.
  This often leads to female characters lacking real character development or depth.
  Some examples of objectified female characters are the multitude in superhero comics. Infamously, the <a href="https://thehawkeyeinitiative.com/"> Hawkeye Initiative </a> responded to the way women were drawn in these comics by redrawing them with men in the same pose.

  <h2 Id="w">Fridged</h2>
  <img style="margin-left: 360px; height: 40%; width: 40%;"src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/18/b3/d7/18b3d7f7c7f1db7c15755751c2b8e83f.gif">
  <p style="font-family:Courier; font-size: 20px; color: grey; margin-left: 4%">
    When a character is "stuffed in the Fridge", they are killed (usually gruesomely) to provoke a reaction from another character.
    It is usually women that are killed in order to motiviate, drive, a male character (usually a protagonist) to do something.
    The term was popularized by Gail Simone, based on a storyline from Green Lantern.
    <h3 style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left: 4%; color: grey; font-family:Courier">Disposable Women</h3>
    <p style="font-family:Courier; font-size: 15px; color: grey; margin-left: 8%; margin-top: 0px;">
      As such, some female characters exist only for the role of being killed off to motivate another. It is common for these 'disposable women' to be replaced quickly by a new female character with a very similar role (only to get killed off again sometimes).
    <h3 style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left: 4%; color: grey; font-family:Courier">Victims</h3>
    <p style="font-family:Courier; font-size: 15px; color: grey; margin-left: 8%; margin-top: 0px;">
      Women are usually brutalized and victimized more drastically than men. For instance, female characters who are sexually assaulted are often shown being unable to function. Simolarly, the psychological and emotion impacts of an attack are often oversimplified.
      Female characters are also prone to being kidnapped or held helpless, in need of rescue.
  <h2 Id="w">Double Standards</h2>
  <img style="float:left; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 20px; height: 30%; width: 30%; " src="https://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/double-standards-comic-illustrations-102-5982e8e40fd85__700.jpg">
  <p style="font-family:Courier; font-size: 20px; color: grey; margin-left: 4%">
    There are various double standards in regards to women in media. These standards encompass perceptions of sexual experience (and how acceptable it is based on gender), race (the differing portrayals of women based on race), characterization, and other factors.
    <h3 style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left: 4%; color: grey; font-family:Courier">Double Standard: Rape</h3>
    <p style="font-family:Courier; font-size: 15px; color: grey; margin-left: 8%; margin-top: 0px;">
      Rape by a woman on a man is often portrayed as being a non-negative event in pop culture. The significance of rape is downplayed and sometimes male characters are expected to have enjoyed the experience if it was done by a female character.
